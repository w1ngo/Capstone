Want to speed up the reading-in of the text file
A few ways to do this 

read-in file during initialization (in the bashrc...make it
	the first action in the driver?)

write to a temporary .csv with an option to add to the end,
	write to a new excel file, or leave-as is/rename 
	temp file

spawn a separate process (using pool for multiprocessing) that
	will start to read in the dataframe while doing the 
	other user i/o (e.g., which modules are being used)

I believe that the best way to do it will be option #2...send it
