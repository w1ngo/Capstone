# Capstone
This repo will store the drivers written for all embedded systems used for the 2022/23 Capstone project

The code will be loaded onto a raspberry pi 4, which serves as the computation hub.

A customized .bashrc file is written to automate some processes when the shell is initiated.

A customized .bash_aliases file is referenced by the .bashrc file to ease shell navigation.

The Raspberry Pi's startup procedures will have our code attached at the end so that the user
	will not have to do anything other than turn the device on.
